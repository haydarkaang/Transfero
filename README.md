## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

To get started with Transfero, make sure you have your environment set up for React Native development.

üëâ Follow the official guide here: [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment)

Once your environment is ready:

```bash
npm install
```

To run Transfero on a physical Android device, make sure you have a debug keystore available. If it's missing, you can generate one manually using the following command from `/android/app/`:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

```

Then, to run the app from `project root directory`:

```bash
npm run android # for Android
cd ios && pod install && cd .. && npm run ios # for iOS
```
